# TOP Rock, Paper, Scissors console game.

My solution to the rock, paper, scissors project reference:\
\
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors
\
\
In general this is a javascript implementation of rock, paper, scissors which displays
on the console.  There is no html displayed when the webpage is opened.\
\
On execution the game asks if you wish to play in 1 of 2 modes:\
    - human player 1 vs computer player 2\
    - computer player 1 vs computer player 2\
    - the user is prompted to make a choice before the game starts.\
\
During each round a player chooses rock, paper, or sciccors by entering 0, 1, or 2:\
    - 0 rock\
    - 1 paper\
    - 2 scissors\
\
Each match consists of 5 rounds.  At the end of each round\
    - player choices are printed\
    - a winner is identified\
    - current player scores are printed\
\
At the end of the game\
    - a winner is identified\
    - player scores are printed.\
\
NOTE: In the event of a tie (i.e. rock vs rock) the round is rerun until a winner 
is identified.
